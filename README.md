# CatanDice
This project is an Android Application that is used with the game Catan (old name Settlers of Catan) and its expansion Cities & Knights.

The application simulates dice (2 or 3 according game type), and make sure the random value they output is fair for the game players.

Fair means that when a tuple of dice appeared, its chance to appear again become very low, until all other tuples appear too.

With this, every player is expected to get resources according the amount of dots under the number token he or she located their settlements, and luck interfere less.
